So in the end why is he willing to give me tacos if I m a lier and supposedly they gave me the tacos? If I was the owner and i in fact gave a patron the tacos why would I give them 2 more tacos??? Makes me wonder if they in fact saw they didn t give me the tacos but wanted to play it off thinking I would just drive off like noooo especially when tacos are so inflated. They have done this before but thankfully I was in the drive thru and noticed they didn t give me my other tacos. At the end of it all I will not be going back and I would recommend checking your bag before leaving the drive thru or they will call you a lier.",

So in the end why is he willing to give me tacos if I m a lier and supposedly they gave me the tacos? If I was the owner and i in fact gave a patron the tacos why would I give them 2 more tacos??? Makes me wonder if they in fact saw they didn t give me the tacos but wanted to play it off thinking I would just drive off like noooo especially when tacos are so inflated. They have done this before but thankfully I was in the drive thru and noticed they didn t give me my other tacos. At the end of it all I will not be going back and I would recommend checking your bag before leaving the drive thru or they will call you a lier.",

    "review_text": "Wow. I was told that I had to try this restaurant. Let me tell you that you will not be disappointed. First of all the tortillas are home made and look like tiny pillows filled with the most tasty food ever. I had the Chile Relleno plate. The only thing I can say that was an issue with the plate is that it only came with one Chile. Lol. It was so good. Come on a Friday and it s the daily special for $7.50. The picture I m dropping was when I had already started eating it. I was so excited that I forgot to take a before. I ordered an Arnold Palmer which was perfect for this meal.",

    "content": "I stopped at La Coronela Mexican Restaurant at 7:10 AM, hoping for a quick and easy breakfast just four breakfast tacos and two coffees. With only two vehicles ahead of me in the drive-thru, I expected to be in and out in no time. Unfortunately, what followed was a frustrating experience that left me both delayed and disappointed. Right from the start, the clerk on the speaker was rude, curtly telling me to \"wait a minute\" without any courtesy. When he finally returned, his attitude worsened with an abrupt, \"What do you want?\" I gave my order clearly, but his dismissive tone continued as he repeatedly said, \"And what else?\" after each item, making me feel like I was inconveniencing him. After placing my order, I pulled forward, becoming the third vehicle in line. A fourth vehicle soon arrived behind me, and I could still hear the clerk s rudeness as he took their order. In fact, the confusion was so bad that the clerk returned twice to the speaker, mistakenly thinking the same vehicle behind me was a new customer, all while the line remained completely stuck. By 7:25 AM, after 15 minutes of no movement, I gave up and left without receiving anything. The whole experience was chaotic, unprofessional, and a waste of time. I may give La Coronela one more chance, but there are other breakfast spots that are friendlier, faster, and more organized even if they re a bit out of my way. A good breakfast isn t just about the food it s about feeling welcomed and respected as a customer. I hope the management at La Coronela addresses these issues and trains their staff to deliver the kind of service that keeps customers coming back.",

After placing my order, I pulled forward, becoming the third vehicle in line. A fourth vehicle soon arrived behind me, and I could still hear the clerk s rudeness as he took their order. In fact, the confusion was so bad that the clerk returned twice to the speaker, mistakenly thinking the same vehicle behind me was a new customer, all while the line remained completely stuck. By 7:25 AM, after 15 minutes of no movement, I gave up and left without receiving anything. The whole experience was chaotic, unprofessional, and a waste of time. I may give La Coronela one more chance, but there are other breakfast spots that are friendlier, faster, and more organized even if they re a bit out of my way. A good breakfast isn t just about the food it s about feeling welcomed and respected as a customer. I hope the management at La Coronela addresses these issues and trains their staff to deliver the kind of service that keeps customers coming back.",

It was nice they put the lettuce and cheese on the side and filled the taco with meat.. was also a generous portion of cheese for 1 taco. I saw other people with grilled plates that looked very good.

They pack their tacos and I'm shocked how flavorful it was. Everything tasted fresh and made well. The salsa Verde has a great taste and a nice little kick. Beef fajita with avacado was on point. Their meat is tender and good quality. They put grilled onions and green bell pepper. Pure perfection. The avacado was fresh. Their sweet tea is delicious. My husband got the Carne guisada and a Teran taco. He said his carne guisada was good. The meat was tender. One taco is filling enough and the prices are unbeatable. The service was extremely friendly and welcoming.",

The atmosphere felt just like a restaurant in Mexico. I ordered the cheese enchiladas plate, and my husband got the barbacoa tacos with all the fixings. The enchiladas came out hot and fresh, and the tortillas for the tacos were homemade so good! Sadly, they were out of horchata since it was so close to closing, but we grabbed some Jarritos instead. The food was absolutely delicious, and the prices were unbeatable! If we had gone to a bigger, fancier Mexican restaurant, it would ve cost three times as much. We spent less than $20 (excluding tip), which was a steal for such great food and service. Highly recommend!",

    "content": "TLDR... Go for the amazing tortillas, tostados, fillings, salsas, all of it! We made a quick trip to San Antonio, and of course wanted breakfast tacos for breakfast on Saturday. I searched a few minutes and found Con Huevos Tacos near us. It was a chilly (for San Antonio) morning and there were several cars in the lot with customers waiting for their order, but there was nobody sitting outside or in line. The signs made it clear that this isn't typical. There are clearly marked locations for ordering and picking up orders. Orders are taken at the window and they text you to let you know when your order is ready. There is plenty of outside seating which is usually great for San Antonio's weather. We would have sat outside if our AirBnB wasn't two minutes away. The food, though, wow! On Saturday, my husband ordered two Carmen tacos, one with a corn tortilla, one with flour, and rojo (red) sauce. I ordered a chilaquiles bowl with verde (green) sauce, with an added fried egg and avocado (note: not sliced, more like guacamole). The pickled onions in my bowl made my taste buds sing. The warm verde sauce was deliciously flavorful. The house-made tostadas, well, we bought a bag this morning (Sunday) to bring home. My husband declared his tacos the best breakfast tacos he'd ever had. We used to live in Austin, so this is high praise. We returned this morning before we left town. I had the chilaquiles taco and hubby had the Carmen and Irma, both on flour. We brought 20 flour tortillas, several sides of refried beans, and a bag of tostadas home with us. We know the tacos we make with them will not stand up to the ones we ate this weekend, but they will be elevated. Learn more about this taco stand on Netflix's Taco Chronicles Cross the Border, San Antonio episode. We watched it after visiting the first time and loved learning more about its background.",

    "review_text": "The first bad food experience we ve ever had in our lives. I m not sure how, but the grey steak felt like chewing chicken and the chicken felt like chewing a mistake. The chicken was pink, the enchilada sauce tasted like two day old pasta sauce, but half as good, and the sauce on the plate was burned to it, meaning it was clearly microwaved. You can taste the can when you eat the beans and the rice was so bad. Somehow, the best thing we got were the canned sodas, and they still tasted off. 8/10 chips and salsa tho",

This restaurant is all outdoors so make sure you wear some layers when it s cold outside! The benches and tables are all decorated with vibrant colors and the artwork around the ordering area was such a vibe. I ended up ordering the michelada (with topo chico), Carne Guisada, Sonia, and the Vick (all corn tortilla). Michelada- this was such a refreshing way to start lunch and I love how the drink came with pickles and olives All three tacos were fantastic- my favorite one was the carne guisada. The beef was tender, juicy, and super flavorful. For all three tacos, it was packed with protein and the toppings (including the salsas) tied everything together so well. Looking forward to coming back here and trying all the other tacos on the menu!",

The restaurant was very clean, and was consistently being picked up by the staff. The tables as people left were being cleaned and wiped down. The salsa bar was very clean, and well stocked. The staff were amazing! They greeted me as I walked up to the register the cashier came around and offered a menu to look at. She took our order down accurately. She was kinda offering some of the desert specials they had. Our order was brought out within 10-15 minutes after order which at this time it was getting busy. Some of the staff members were going around offering some deserts. They have indoor seating, outdoor covered seating, and a drive thru. Thank you for the great service each and every one of your staff members I interacted with provided.",

So the plate was a picadillo enchilada plate and the potatoes weren't cooked all the way. Which is not what I was wanting in the first place. The beans on the plate smelled and tasted old, the rice had no flavor. Sauce for the enchilada plate was good. The beans were the same for the tacos which made me question the sanitariness of them. The carne guisada tacos were good flavorful but my husband said they didn't come out good the next day. The carne asada was good with our homemade salsa he said but wasn't sure on its own. The fajita ranchera taco was good and flavorful. The tortillas did not taste homemade.

Mind you she only ate it because we had already asked them to remake it and we asked the first time for no meat and told them she was vegan so when they brought it around the second time we thought it would be fine.

I said that s fine! thinking lunch special was $7.99 I Was Thinking Maybe I at the most paying $15 in total, my ticket came up to almost $20 because the barbacoa taco was almost $6.00 it self, but it wasn t a big size taco either just regular size.

It's conveniently located next to the VA so I will likely be back pretty regularly. They also have a salsa bar the \"extra spicy\" is my favorite (although extra spicy is a stretch) it definitely had my nose dripping slightly but nothing extreme just a really nice heat.",

The tortillas were stale and the salsa was sour. I ordered 2 basic potato and cheese tacos and my husband had 2 egg and el Mexicana tacos, we couldn t even eat them they were so disgusting. We literally had to throw them away. Such a waste of money!",

It's important for anyone in a leadership position to leave personal problems at home and treat customers with respect. I noticed she even whispered to another server to bring me my tacos, which struck me as unprofessional for an owner. Every customer deserves a warm and respectful greeting, regardless of the situation. I couldn't help but feel that she would insist even a blind customer read the menu, rather than take the time to help. I hope Mari understands the potential impact of her attitude on your business. I sincerely wish that future customers do not have to endure the same experience I did. HOPE this helps everyone on making there decisions on a place to grab a taco.

There is something peculiar about the seasoning and it s tougher than other places I ve visited. The carne asada meat also looks irregular. I can t figure out what it is but I ll be visiting again to get some different opinions on it. It d be great to have a decent taco spot in 09 that isn t a higher end like Sol Luna or Paloma Blanca. I d hoped las Palapas would offer that but time and time again it doesn t deliver. Service was nice. Place wasn t busy during weekday lunch hour.",

We ordered lunch and it was delicious. The last time I had carnitas was over 10+ years ago at a Mexican restaurant in Lansing, MI. I have not found any carnitas that have been good and not dry, this place is great!! I know I try to go off of reviews but a lot of times you just have to just trust. I pray that this review helps, but the most important issue is your soul. Where are you going when you die?? It s either heaven or hell. It s either you have a personal relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ and be reconciled back to the Father God, through only the Son Jesus Christ, or you perish and go to hell. We are all born sinners, you have a decision (the most important decision to make in your life). We will ALL have to stand before a holy, perfect, and just God, and give an account of our lives. Our lives are being recorded, this should make you think. Repent while you still can, ask for forgiveness of your sins. We have all fallen short of the glory of God. Our works are filthy rags to a holy God, the true and living God. The One who is perfect and when He came to this earth, Jesus Christ the Son of God, He came as God in the FLESH. Because He loved you so much!!!! The gospel is simply put Jesus Christ who is also God, the Holy One of Israel, He came to die for all of mankind and take all of our sins and put them on Himself. His own forsook Him and did not know who He was. They mocked Him, spat on Him, beat Him, and so much more than our minds could even comprehend. His blood (the perfect Lamb that was the sacrifice, the last sacrifice) was shed for the forgiveness of sins. He died on the cross for you, and was buried, and on the third day, Alleluia, He rose from the grave. Why? Because Jesus Christ is God. He had the power to take His life and the power to take up His life again!! Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; by which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; and that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: 1 Corinthians 15 : 1 - 4 KJV For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 6 : 23 KJV for all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; Romans 3 : 23 KJV No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father. John 10 : 18 KJV I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty. Revelation 1 : 8 KJV Jesus is coming back soon!! Be ready!! who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed. 1 Peter 2 : 24 KJV But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. Isaiah 53 : 5 KJV Get yourself a King James Bible and please read for yourself!! You must be born again or you will not see the kingdom of God! Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born? Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. John 3 : 3 - 5 KJV",

Sat behind water jug area and waited about 7more min till someone got my drink order. With drink order got me a bean cheese and bacon taco, if that simply taco passes the taste test then all food should be great. Well it was great, beans tasted great and the bacon was on point. Wanted to place order soon after for the main dish well that took a while to take. Finally waitress took order down while refilling my coffee and asked her to take the main dish down. Order me two pork chops with scramble eggs and instead of regular potato s wanted chorizo potato s no problem. After a few min a lady was filling up the water jug containers right behind me and bammm my back got splashed on with lots of water. Turned around and seen her filling up water jug but no sorry or acknowledgment of wetting me lol ok let it be but then Waited 30min and was getting up to leave and cancel order when I see my possible plate placed on the window and waitress hurrying to bring to me seeing I was about to leave. So I stayed and tried it out. All good tasted good, homemade tortillas and all. Just wished they were more attentive to the wait. Yes your busy but it s my first time there not sure if this is typical of wait or so but some assurance of order put in and it s on the way goes a long way. Other than getting wet and two solicitors approaching for cakes and other stuff all was good. Food tasted great just the little things. Will try again some time if I m in area tho.",

But these pass couple of days their tacos have been almost empty. The food is good, Don't get me wrong but look at my picture. For a $3 almost $4 dollar taco not worth it. In total I got $10 all of them were the same and I paid $39. 97 for 10 tacos that look like this.. I won't be going there for a while.",

My wife has been going for years and finally took me with our children. Wasn't disappointed at all. Reminded me of growing up and eating at those old, comfortable, grandma's house feelings. Happy memories were also made here when I went. Thank you to the staff for making us feel at home and tasting some great food. We'll be back soon again I'm sure of it!",

It s at that magical volume where you can vibe with the tunes and have a conversation without feeling like you need a megaphone to chat with your table. The restrooms? Sparkling clean. (Honestly, who doesn t appreciate that?) Now, let s give a shout-out to our fabulous server, Elvia! Attentive, polite, and all-around delightful. She kept our chips and salsa flowing like a pro. Speaking of chips they re light, airy, and dangerously addictive. The salsa? It s got just the right kick to remind you that life s too short for bland food. And now, the main event: the food! The caldo de res was pure comfort in a bowl rich, flavorful broth with loads of tender meat. It s served piping hot with your choice of homemade corn or flour tortillas. (Spoiler: you ll want both.) Then came the Mexican Hamburger and let me tell you, it s a beast. This burger is massive, juicy, and packed with more fresh meat than a prison yard! You won t leave hungry, that s for sure. The Fideo Loco? Served with charro beans and seasoned to perfection. One bite, and you ll wonder why you ever settled for boring noodles. And let s not forget the cheese enchiladas melty, well-seasoned, and bursting with flavor. They hit all the right notes. Long story short, this spot checks all the boxes: great food, great vibes, and a server like Elvia who makes you feel like family. We ll be back for round two and maybe even thirds!",

    "review_text": "I came here thinking it was as good as the first Ranchero (the one on fair) and I ordered a bean and cheese with a barbacoa taco both tacos were COLD not even LUKEWARM, the beans were flavorless and the barbacoa was pink, not pink-ISH, but PINK, like bright PINK. I tasted it and man, honestly one of the worst barbacoa tacos, the sweet tea is good but even when you ask for Little ice please the cup comes with 75% ice and 25% water. Customer service was very good, the waitress (sorry i forgot the name) was very polite and friendly. But it still doesnt excuse MESSING UP A BEAN AND CHEEESE!!!!!!!!!! *just go to Las Tapatias or sum",

We entered to a very nice interior decoration for the seating and tables. We were quickly greeted, and our drink orders were taken. After the drink orders were brought to us, our server took our breakfast orders. We all decided to get breakfast tacos on their homemade tortillas. Our orders range from chorizo and egg tacos, migas tacos, and bacon and egg tacos. In all, the food was very good.

The man on the phone, Robert, was so kind, and even asked if we were celebrating something. I mentioned that we were having a get-together, and he said that was wonderful.

They gave me some salt but said they charge for additional salsa s. I had already swiped my card and didn t want to do that again for .75 cents. And I think .75 cents is way too much for a tiny salsa container. So I had one tiny salsa for three tacos. This left my tacos feeling dry and tasting flavorless. So if you actually like salsa on your tacos, I suppose just ordering one taco would be an option. Or you could go to just about any other restaurant and they ll give you more salsa if you ask for it.

The staff is friendly and fast, even during the late-night rush. Whether you re bar hopping or just craving something amazing, this spot delivers. Don t sleep on it.",

Unfortunately, Chips were stale and salsa was watery Steak was bland and tough The corn shells were saturated with what tasted like old vegetable oil.

    "review_text": "After seeing the reviews about this place, and it being around the corner from my Drs office, i was tempted to try it out. I was disappointed. I must have caught them on an off day. Got my usual of steak tacos. It came with chips & salsa, and charro beans. I was pleased by that. Unfortunately, Chips were stale and salsa was watery Steak was bland and tough The corn shells were saturated with what tasted like old vegetable oil. Fortunately, Parking was abundant and restaurant was clean Server was amicable Pricing was great Charro beans were flavorful and were the highlight. If i'm in the neighborhood, and am craving tacos, i may give them another shot.",

At least try a little salt in the eggs. Second time pancake plate $10.99. again nothing special. the only thing I can say about the plate is the portion wasn't bad. Two good size pancakes, two eggs ordered over medium slightly overcooked, two slices of bacon and toast. Again the eggs completely bland and unseasoned. Pancakes were nothing special. The toast was just two pieces of traditional white bread. That weren't remotely toasted at all. In fact at best they might have been slapped on a flat iron grill for 2 seconds on either side. The star of the show was the bacon and even that was nothing special. Third time Carne guisada taco. Literally steak on a flour tortilla $3.99. Again nothing fabulous. More carne asada than guisada. Bland and flavorless. This last time I settled for crispy Taco plate 10.99. three tacos your choice beef or chicken served with the rice and beans I chose beef. Tacos were literally flavorless beef with some lettuce tomato and cheese thrown on top star of the show was the rice. Can honestly say I'm highly disappointed. Heard great things and read many great reviews regarding their other location. Waited what seem like a century for them to finish construction and open. Was absolutely hyped when they finally did. However it seems like just a swing and a miss. Not to mention they charge an additional 40 cents per plate just to box your food to go. The only Plus is its location relative to my work and making it a convenient place to grab a quick bite however I can get more tasteful food from the 7-Eleven next door.",

The burritos are also great, and the quesadillas are a good option if you're looking for something lighter. The restaurant has ample indoor seating, which is great for those hot summer days. The dining room is small and intimate, but it's always clean and well-maintained. The staff is friendly and attentive, and they always go the extra mile to make sure you have a great dining experience. Overall, I highly recommend Taqueria Datapoint to anyone looking for authentic Mexican food in San Antonio. It's a great place to go for a casual meal with friends or family.",

The dining room is small and intimate, but it's always clean and well-maintained. The staff is friendly and attentive, and they always go the extra mile to make sure you have a great dining experience. Overall, I highly recommend Taqueria Datapoint to anyone looking for authentic Mexican food in San Antonio. It's a great place to go for a casual meal with friends or family.",

I ve never been to a Mexican restaurant where they don t know how to cook Mexican food. Honestly this is sad for San Antonio as a whole. We have to do better.

    "content": "Restaurant Review: Bitterly Disappointed with Breakfast Burrito Experience I recently visited hoping to enjoy a solid breakfast burrito and left feeling incredibly disappointed. For $13, I received a watermelon drink (which was perfectly fine) and a breakfast burrito that fell far short of expectations. I ordered a sausage breakfast burrito, and the server even confirmed my preference country sausage, patties, or links. I chose links, thinking I d get proper link sausage. Instead, what I received were those tiny pig-in-a-blanket-style hot dogs. To make matters worse, the eggs inside were undercooked, and the red sauce I poured over the burrito had an overwhelming tomato paste flavor not the rich, spicy salsa you d expect with Mexican-inspired cuisine. After eating Mexican food for over 30 years, I can confidently say I ve never had salsa that tasted quite like that. When my server checked in and I asked if the sausage was actually mini hot dogs, she confirmed it with a nod no apology or explanation. At that point, I just tried to eat what I could since I didn t have time to wait for a corrected order. Honestly, I worried that asking for a redo might result in my food being tampered with, so I just left frustrated. For $13, I expect better quality and attention to detail. Mistakes happen, but getting the order right the first time is crucial especially when the alternative is food that leaves you questioning what you re even eating. I won t be returning.",

So I waited and waited- and waited and waited and waited, {SpongeBob narrator} 45 minutes later ~ and still NOTHING (No- how s everything ? kinda deal) I then decided I had to go to the cashier and walk my butt up and go to order my food and I see my waitress as I approach the restaurant s register and mind you lord and behold there she was, on her phone Sitting down !!!!! Well no wonder I wasn t being acknowledged The other young lady, next to her looks at me ? I then say- I need to order to go please? So she ultimately tells the lady - still sitting down can you help her!

    "review_text": "I ordered chicken caldo it was really cold and no veggies, was so disappointed But couldn t reorder or take it back because I was scared they d be pissed and spit or something if returned. Not today satan, not in my food! So I then decided to order- to go- tacos, with that being said apparently the rule is we have to order then and there okay fine, so I waited for my waitress to come check on us and at that point I d order my food. So I waited and waited- and waited and waited and waited, {SpongeBob narrator} 45 minutes later ~ and still NOTHING (No- how s everything ? kinda deal) I then decided I had to go to the cashier and walk my butt up and go to order my food and I see my waitress as I approach the restaurant s register and mind you lord and behold there she was, on her phone Sitting down !!!!! Well no wonder I wasn t being acknowledged The other young lady, next to her looks at me ? I then say- I need to order to go please? So she ultimately tells the lady - still sitting down can you help her!

I didn't get any chips or salsa the server didn'toffer any so i was kinda bummed... m The meat was a struggle to chew. I feel like they microwave my guisada, because it didn't taste fresh at all. Cheese enchiladas are okay. The tortilla is thin and crispy.. the beans were definitely on point.",

When we needed refills, he never once came by our table to see how everything was going and if we needed any refills or anything else. Then we noticed a couple who came in and sat next to us. They waited for quite some time before he even came around to wait on them. He was too busy talking to someone at the door exit. Then my friend had to get up and look for someone to get him a refill on his tea. Finally, when we were ready to leave, we waited for our ticket and never got it. So we just got up and headed towards the cashier to pay. I'm sure that this employee has been there for some time. Maybe the establishment needs to make a change.

    "content": "In San Antonio's Southtown neighborhood, where the hum of downtown fades and Victorian homes stand sentinel, Cascabel Mexican Patio offers something increasingly rare: a portal to Mexico's interior that requires no passport. Occupying a modest frame house painted in carnival colors, this 19-year-old establishment stands defiantly against the Tex-Mex hegemony that dominates the city's culinary landscape. Under rustling palapa fronds and papel picado banners that dance in the breeze, diners at wooden tables savor dishes that speak more of Oaxaca and Puebla than the border. The patio, with its weathered wooden posts wrapped in twinkling lights and festive ribbons, creates an atmosphere so transportive that the nearby urban surroundings momentarily disappear. Inside, walls of emerald green, cobalt blue, and hibiscus red showcase sunflower motifs and folk art decorations. The space feels less like a restaurant and more like the home of a particularly colorful Mexican grandmother who insists you eat well before leaving. The menu, unchanged for years, begins not with the expected chips and salsa but with a complimentary cup of sopa de fideo a comforting vermicelli soup that serves as Cascabel's edible welcome mat. This small gesture signals the restaurant's commitment to authenticity over American expectations. The kitchen's strengths emerge in dishes rarely seen north of the Rio Grande. Their huaraches sandal-shaped corn masa topped with beans, meats, and salsa verde offer a textural symphony that makes typical nachos seem one-dimensional by comparison. The puerco a la cascabel features tender cubes of pork immersed in a sauce of smoky cascabel chiles, served alongside properly prepared black beans (never pinto) and orange-hued Mexican rice that bears no resemblance to its tomato-tinged Tex-Mex cousin. For the culinary adventurer, the quesadilla de huitlacoche delivers the earthy funk of corn fungus (often called \"Mexican truffle\") melted with cheese between house-made tortillas. This delicacy, compared by some to truffles but with a flavor profile entirely its own, is a rare find in Texas restaurants and worth seeking out for those who collect uncommon food experiences. At lunch, plates generously portioned and artfully arranged on bright Fiestaware cost under $15 including tax a value proposition that explains the diverse clientele, from neighborhood locals to curious visitors. The lunch-only hours (10 a.m. to 3 p.m. weekdays, closing at 4 p.m. Saturdays, closed Sundays) create an air of exclusivity by accident rather than design. The mole poblano, with its deeper chocolate notes than most American iterations, and the pozole that locals whisper about should not be missed. But it's the pibil slow-cooked achiote-marinated pork that might justify a special journey. Service happens at a pace that honors conversation rather than turnover. Older couples linger under the palapa, seemingly transported to vacation memories of coastal Mexico. Young professionals squeeze in quick lunches, smartphones momentarily forgotten amid the sensory distraction. What Cascabel lacks in sleek efficiency it compensates for with something more valuable: authenticity without pretension. There are no QR codes, no elaborate cocktail program, no claims of \"elevation\" or \"reimagination\" of traditional cuisine. Instead, you'll find a sanctuary of unhurried dining where recipes remain as they have been prepared for generations in Mexican homes. In a city famous for its tourist-friendly River Walk restaurants, Cascabel represents the road less traveled a culinary detour that rewards the curious with flavors more complex and environments more genuine than those found on well-worn paths. For travelers tired of experiencing destinations through the sanitized lens of tourism, this modest house with its vibrant food offers something increasingly precious: a taste of somewhere else, honestly rendered.",

The puerco a la cascabel features tender cubes of pork immersed in a sauce of smoky cascabel chiles, served alongside properly prepared black beans (never pinto) and orange-hued Mexican rice that bears no resemblance to its tomato-tinged Tex-Mex cousin. For the culinary adventurer, the quesadilla de huitlacoche delivers the earthy funk of corn fungus (often called \"Mexican truffle\") melted with cheese between house-made tortillas. This delicacy, compared by some to truffles but with a flavor profile entirely its own, is a rare find in Texas restaurants and worth seeking out for those who collect uncommon food experiences. At lunch, plates generously portioned and artfully arranged on bright Fiestaware cost under $15 including tax a value proposition that explains the diverse clientele, from neighborhood locals to curious visitors. The lunch-only hours (10 a.m. to 3 p.m. weekdays, closing at 4 p.m. Saturdays, closed Sundays) create an air of exclusivity by accident rather than design. The mole poblano, with its deeper chocolate notes than most American iterations, and the pozole that locals whisper about should not be missed. But it's the pibil slow-cooked achiote-marinated pork that might justify a special journey. Service happens at a pace that honors conversation rather than turnover. Older couples linger under the palapa, seemingly transported to vacation memories of coastal Mexico. Young professionals squeeze in quick lunches, smartphones momentarily forgotten amid the sensory distraction. What Cascabel lacks in sleek efficiency it compensates for with something more valuable: authenticity without pretension. There are no QR codes, no elaborate cocktail program, no claims of \"elevation\" or \"reimagination\" of traditional cuisine. Instead, you'll find a sanctuary of unhurried dining where recipes remain as they have been prepared for generations in Mexican homes. In a city famous for its tourist-friendly River Walk restaurants, Cascabel represents the road less traveled a culinary detour that rewards the curious with flavors more complex and environments more genuine than those found on well-worn paths. For travelers tired of experiencing destinations through the sanitized lens of tourism, this modest house with its vibrant food offers something increasingly precious: a taste of somewhere else, honestly rendered.",

The young lady who took my order was absolutely awesome.Welcomed me before.I even finished walking through the door. I ordered a large coffee.Also which came in a 32 ounce cup, which is no longer available at many Mexican restaurants.So I was glad to know that I could get one and she gave me french vanilla creamer from the fridge. The coffee was great also. The menu looks simple and easy to choose from. I was also glad the food turn around was really quick. She told me they opened up about 5 am. in the morning and close about 2 pm. if i'm correct. I am definitely going to stop in again and check out the Lil Johnny's Big Taco for sure. Thank you for your service, kindness, professionalism, fresh coffee, and, of course, my tacos. See you very soon!",

His friendly demeanor and professionalism set a great tone for the meal. I started with the $5 chips and salsa, which were fresh and flavorful a great way to kick off the meal. For my main dish, I ordered the short rib tacos. The portion of beef in each taco was generous and perfectly cooked, making every bite satisfying. The rice and beans on the side were also well-seasoned and complemented the tacos beautifully. While the food was delicious, I would suggest serving the salsa for the tacos in a ramekin instead of directly on the plate. It would elevate the presentation and make the dish feel a bit more polished. Acenar delivers on both taste and service, with hearty portions and bold flavors. The short rib tacos are a standout dish, and the overall experience was delightful. With just a small tweak in presentation, it would be absolutely perfect. I ll definitely return for another great meal!",
