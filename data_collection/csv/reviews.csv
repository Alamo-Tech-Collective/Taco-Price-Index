There's been an apparent change in ownership or management. If true, and without any sort of public signage to indicate this seems disingenuous as an effort to use the existing brand.

I support small and local businesses, and I write this with hope of some quick implementation of this and any other feedback the new staff receive. I understand times are hard, rent on the Broadway strip must be insane. I would be fine with the price increases if the quality and/or quantity of the food matched. Even if it meant waiting longer for food to be prepared and cooked. I believe this will allow for rebuilding clientele with the lower volume of patronage, then as it increases hopefully prices can be reduced to offset ticket times.

Everyone seems nice enough. No current complaint in service received. I hope everyone does their best so we can have delicious food for years to come.

The atmosphere was a bit dead, gone are the decorations that adorned and brought out the cultural charm. I hope this returns especially as it's dia de los muertos soon. The music videos that used the play also made everything more vibrant, made me feel like I was in Monterrey. Finally it was a bit dim which made things feel cold and unwelcoming, let's get some warm lighting back up.

The biggest things I noticed, the salsas are very different. I will miss the very spicy old salsa Verde and the very wine-ish salsa roja.

Huevos Rancheros and Huevos Divorciados do not come with bacon ü•ì anymore üòû

Menudo is gone, I hope for it's return now that is just starting to get cool out for autumn üçÇ

The tortillas weren't as fluffy. Mine were actually a bit rough and chewy that took some effort pulling that resulted in a snap to break off a piece. Could've just been a bad batch ü§û as this happens at other Mexican restaurants on occasion.

I'll make periodic updates here as I give this a few more visits with any noticeable changes üôè",1729309228,7 months ago,en,2024-10-18T22:40:28

The place inside has very beautiful art, decorating the inside.  Bathrooms have been remodeled.  The place was full of tables with plate cups from previous patrons, and none seemed to be addressing it. No biggie, just an observation. Once we got our food, we never got service again no one came to our table, and even the other waitresses that walked by total tunnel vision never glanced over our way.

We were going to place some orders to go for our children for when they got home from school plus some desserts etc but nobody ever came to the table to we finished our meal walked to the back to pay yet no one knew who had our ticket they kept asking around who had our table finally someone brought up our ticket we paid and left.

With only two vehicles ahead of me in the drive-thru, I expected to be in and out in no time. Unfortunately, what followed was a frustrating experience that left me both delayed and disappointed.

Right from the start, the clerk on the speaker was rude, curtly telling me to ""wait a minute"" without any courtesy. When he finally returned, his attitude worsened with an abrupt, ""What do you want?"" I gave my order clearly, but his dismissive tone continued as he repeatedly said, ""And what else?"" after each item, making me feel like I was inconveniencing him.

After placing my order, I pulled forward, becoming the third vehicle in line. A fourth vehicle soon arrived behind me, and I could still hear the clerk‚Äôs rudeness as he took their order. In fact, the confusion was so bad that the clerk returned twice to the speaker, mistakenly thinking the same vehicle behind me was a new customer, all while the line remained completely stuck.

By 7:25 AM, after 15 minutes of no movement, I gave up and left without receiving anything. The whole experience was chaotic, unprofessional, and a waste of time.

I may give La Coronela one more chance, but there are other breakfast spots that are friendlier, faster, and more organized‚Äîeven if they‚Äôre a bit out of my way. A good breakfast isn‚Äôt just about the food‚Äîit‚Äôs about feeling welcomed and respected as a customer.

I hope the management at La Coronela addresses these issues and trains their staff to deliver the kind of service that keeps customers coming back.",1739888199,3 months ago,en,2025-02-18T08:16:39

I have a friend who used to eat frequently at one of the other locations. Since I had heard so much about Los Dos Laredos, I decided to give it a try. His family prefers it over the places I frequent.

I ordered the enchilada plate with a taco. The food came out quickly and was nice and hot. Chips and salsa were served with the plate. The food was pretty good, but I still prefer my favorite places for enchiladas.

Service was good, prices were fair and the portions were large. I would return here again to try some more items. The menu had a huge selection on it.",1632567957,3 years ago,en,2021-09-25T06:05:57

ChIJw4ztpKhYXIYRuKpymLUwmyM,Jeremy Edmunds,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104044528977357225239/reviews,5,"In San Antonio's Southtown neighborhood, where the hum of downtown fades and Victorian homes stand sentinel, Cascabel Mexican Patio offers something increasingly rare: a portal to Mexico's interior that requires no passport. Occupying a modest frame house painted in carnival colors, this 19-year-old establishment stands defiantly against the Tex-Mex hegemony that dominates the city's culinary landscape.

Under rustling palapa fronds and papel picado banners that dance in the breeze, diners at wooden tables savor dishes that speak more of Oaxaca and Puebla than the border. The patio, with its weathered wooden posts wrapped in twinkling lights and festive ribbons, creates an atmosphere so transportive that the nearby urban surroundings momentarily disappear.

Inside, walls of emerald green, cobalt blue, and hibiscus red showcase sunflower motifs and folk art decorations. The space feels less like a restaurant and more like the home of a particularly colorful Mexican grandmother who insists you eat well before leaving.

The menu, unchanged for years, begins not with the expected chips and salsa but with a complimentary cup of sopa de fideo ‚Äì a comforting vermicelli soup that serves as Cascabel's edible welcome mat. This small gesture signals the restaurant's commitment to authenticity over American expectations.

The kitchen's strengths emerge in dishes rarely seen north of the Rio Grande. Their huaraches ‚Äì sandal-shaped corn masa topped with beans, meats, and salsa verde ‚Äì offer a textural symphony that makes typical nachos seem one-dimensional by comparison. The puerco a la cascabel features tender cubes of pork immersed in a sauce of smoky cascabel chiles, served alongside properly prepared black beans (never pinto) and orange-hued Mexican rice that bears no resemblance to its tomato-tinged Tex-Mex cousin.

For the culinary adventurer, the quesadilla de huitlacoche delivers the earthy funk of corn fungus (often called ""Mexican truffle"") melted with cheese between house-made tortillas. This delicacy, compared by some to truffles but with a flavor profile entirely its own, is a rare find in Texas restaurants and worth seeking out for those who collect uncommon food experiences.

At lunch, plates generously portioned and artfully arranged on bright Fiestaware cost under $15 including tax ‚Äì a value proposition that explains the diverse clientele, from neighborhood locals to curious visitors. The lunch-only hours (10 a.m. to 3 p.m. weekdays, closing at 4 p.m. Saturdays, closed Sundays) create an air of exclusivity by accident rather than design.

The mole poblano, with its deeper chocolate notes than most American iterations, and the pozole that locals whisper about should not be missed. But it's the pibil ‚Äì slow-cooked achiote-marinated pork ‚Äì that might justify a special journey.

Service happens at a pace that honors conversation rather than turnover. Older couples linger under the palapa, seemingly transported to vacation memories of coastal Mexico. Young professionals squeeze in quick lunches, smartphones momentarily forgotten amid the sensory distraction.

What Cascabel lacks in sleek efficiency it compensates for with something more valuable: authenticity without pretension. There are no QR codes, no elaborate cocktail program, no claims of ""elevation"" or ""reimagination"" of traditional cuisine. Instead, you'll find a sanctuary of unhurried dining where recipes remain as they have been prepared for generations in Mexican homes.

In a city famous for its tourist-friendly River Walk restaurants, Cascabel represents the road less traveled ‚Äì a culinary detour that rewards the curious with flavors more complex and environments more genuine than those found on well-worn paths. For travelers tired of experiencing destinations through the sanitized lens of tourism, this modest house with its vibrant food offers something increasingly precious: a taste of somewhere else, honestly rendered.",1744137034,a month ago,en,2025-04-08T13:30:34

I recently visited hoping to enjoy a solid breakfast burrito and left feeling incredibly disappointed. For $13, I received a watermelon drink (which was perfectly fine) and a breakfast burrito that fell far short of expectations.

I ordered a sausage breakfast burrito, and the server even confirmed my preference ‚Äî country sausage, patties, or links. I chose links, thinking I‚Äôd get proper link sausage. Instead, what I received were those tiny pig-in-a-blanket-style hot dogs.

To make matters worse, the eggs inside were undercooked, and the red sauce I poured over the burrito had an overwhelming tomato paste flavor ‚Äî not the rich, spicy salsa you‚Äôd expect with Mexican-inspired cuisine. After eating Mexican food for over 30 years, I can confidently say I‚Äôve never had salsa that tasted quite like that.

When my server checked in and I asked if the ‚Äúsausage‚Äù was actually mini hot dogs, she confirmed it with a nod ‚Äî no apology or explanation. At that point, I just tried to eat what I could since I didn‚Äôt have time to wait for a corrected order.

My order was taken by a woman named Mari, who identified herself as the owner after I inquired about her name due to her rude customer service. When I asked for the price of one taco, she directed me to the menu in a condescending manner.

It's important for anyone in a leadership position to leave personal problems at home and
treat customers with respect. I noticed she even whispered to another server to bring me my tacos, which struck me as unprofessional for an owner.

Every customer deserves a warm and respectful greeting, regardless of the situation. I couldn't help but feel that she would insist even a blind customer read the menu, rather than take the time to help.

I hope Mari understands the potential impact of her attitude on your business. I sincerely wish that future customers do not have to endure the same experience I did.

I‚Äôm a food service worker myself and when a customer complains about the food, we either offer something in exchange or take it off the ticket. And not give an answer like ‚Äú oh well no one has said anything about the menudo‚Äù  now that‚Äôs great customer service!!! Oh and to top it off there was a bug in my husband‚Äôs drink and we still paid for it.",1726502814,8 months ago,en,2024-09-16T11:06:54

I have not found any carnitas that have been good and not dry, this place is great!! I know I try to go off of reviews but a lot of times you just have to just trust.
I pray that this review helps, but the most important issue is your soul.
Where are you going when you die??
It‚Äôs either heaven or hell. It‚Äôs either you have a personal relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ and be reconciled back to the Father God, through only the Son Jesus Christ, or you perish and go to hell. We are all born sinners, you have a decision (the most important decision to make in your life).
We will ALL have to stand before a holy, perfect, and just God, and give an account of our lives. Our lives are being recorded, this should make you think.
Repent while you still can, ask for forgiveness of your sins. We have all fallen short of the glory of God. Our ‚Äúworks‚Äù are filthy rags to a holy God, the true and living God. The One who is perfect and when He came to this earth, Jesus Christ the Son of God, He came as God in the FLESH. Because He loved you so much!!!! The gospel is simply put Jesus Christ who is also God, the Holy One of Israel, He came to die for all of mankind and take all of our sins and put them on Himself. His own forsook Him and did not know who He was. They mocked Him, spat on Him, beat Him, and so much more than our minds could even comprehend. His blood (the perfect Lamb that was the sacrifice, the last sacrifice) was shed for the forgiveness of sins. He died on the cross for you, and was buried, and on the third day,
Alleluia, He rose from the grave. Why? Because Jesus Christ is God. He had the power to take His life and the power to take up His life again!!

‚ÄúMoreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; by which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; and that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:‚Äù
‚Ä≠‚Ä≠1 Corinthians‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠15‚Ä¨:‚Ä≠1‚Ä¨-‚Ä≠4‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠KJV‚Ä¨‚Ä¨

‚ÄúFor the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.‚Äù
‚Ä≠‚Ä≠Romans‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠6‚Ä¨:‚Ä≠23‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠KJV‚Ä¨‚Ä¨

‚Äúfor all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;‚Äù
‚Ä≠‚Ä≠Romans‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠3‚Ä¨:‚Ä≠23‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠KJV‚Ä¨‚Ä¨

‚ÄúNo man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.‚Äù
‚Ä≠‚Ä≠John‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠10‚Ä¨:‚Ä≠18‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠KJV‚Ä¨‚Ä¨

‚ÄúI am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.‚Äù
‚Ä≠‚Ä≠Revelation‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠1‚Ä¨:‚Ä≠8‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠KJV‚Ä¨‚Ä¨

Jesus is coming back soon!!
Be ready!!

‚Äúwho his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed.‚Äù
‚Ä≠‚Ä≠1 Peter‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠2‚Ä¨:‚Ä≠24‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠KJV‚Ä¨‚Ä¨

‚ÄúBut he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.‚Äù
‚Ä≠‚Ä≠Isaiah‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠53‚Ä¨:‚Ä≠5‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠KJV‚Ä¨‚Ä¨

Get yourself a King James Bible and please read for yourself!! You must be born again or you will not see the kingdom of God!

‚Ä¨‚Ä¨ ‚ÄúJesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born? Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.‚Äù

Huge problem is Female service worker up front was very rude.  Sheim Looks  grumpy all the time.  Has no customer service skills and has been noted every time I visit.
May have to really talk with owners soon this is not really acceptable.
Today talked with part owner after  nasty service from the same grumpy  female that has no idea of what customer service is and doesn't charge for patrons service connected accurately.  But there was a correction after disputed it but was not good with refusing food not prepared in a manner expected from this restaurant.  Arguing my point of view was noted a fail here.  Very sloppy order.  Not sure how this will further my coming back with this  attitude and unkindness.

I have no idea how people can eat their hideous food. Food used to be soooo good when it was a small restaurant, the owner would come by and ask if you‚Äôd needed anything else. Breakfast tacos was my favorite thing go eat there. Well long story short today I ordered red chilaquiles and they‚Äôre usually made with a guajillo sauce, I‚Äôm not crazy, I remember eating them like that there. When my plate showed up it looked nothing like the menu photo or how I remembered them being. I asked waitress if those were the only chilaquiles rojos they had and she stated that they had changed them. But that next time I would have to tell her I wanted them with guagillo sauce and that they would be able to make them. I said ok fine, I‚Äôll just eat these, didn‚Äôt wanna look too picky‚Ä¶I took the very first bite of them and it was just so gross, they threw ranchera sauce on them and cold cheese on top, the sause tasted like straight up tap water, I don‚Äôt know  how else to describe the taste but it was  NASTY! I kindly told the waitress I won‚Äôt be able to eat that plate because the sauce had a nasty taste. She said no problem, she would have the cook make them with the sauce I wanted. I saw when she went to tell the cook to remake them and he made a really ugly face, he was very bothered to have to remake something that was freaking nasty in the first place. I don‚Äôt know if they know but the customers can see their faces from far away into the kitchen. I saw how upset he was making my food. Upon food arriving to table I noticed they just dumped the same nasty powdered eggs back in the plate and the same nasty and smelly pork chop and on top of that the ‚Äúfreshly made‚Äù sauce was cold. At this point I just wanted to eat whatever was on my plate and leave. Cashier asked if everything was ok and I said no, but didn‚Äôt bother to ask what was wrong. This place sucks, don‚Äôt waste your money. They don‚Äôt care to make you have a pleasant experience, they‚Äôre just inviting people to never come back.

I ordered a sweet tea in order of fries, two sausage and potato tacos, one with cheese and a potato and egg taco for my little girl The french fries had a hard freezer burn taste, and they tried to cover it up with a ton of salt, which I don‚Äôt expect anything less when it comes to french fries moving onto my tacos given its a Mexican restaurant. I would‚Äôve assumed that they can‚Äôt fail the most easiest tacos, but that wasn‚Äôt the case the potatoes were very hard and big. The sausage was perfect and so was the tortilla for the one with cheese. I moved onto the second taco and didn‚Äôt wanna even eat it because the taste of the potato burn was just so gross and very strong. I looked at my daughter‚Äòs potato and egg taco. When I tell you this is the wateriest taco I have ever seen. I mean it the tortilla was falling apart from I‚Äôm assuming the natural Egg water if that‚Äôs even a thing lol I just have to assume cause there‚Äôs no excuse for how runny that egg was and the potatoes the tortilla soaked it up but I wasn‚Äôt going to have my three year-old eat the potatoes i went to wash it off with the sweet tea I ordered, and it tasted like the sweet tea has been sitting there for days and just probably got mixed around And some ice thrown in there to make it fresh. I called the manager to let them know the issue made it known that I was willing to drive back or even walk because it‚Äôs right down the street for me and was ok to give the food and tea back and just get a refund for what was not touched and she told me no she can‚Äôt do that. She can only remake the order and I wasn‚Äôt willing to eat trash Mexican food again from here Now given this is my first time. It will also be my last and I‚Äôm just saying to anyone reading this if you made it this far, don‚Äôt be afraid to try the taco at the drive-through or check the order or rather just eat inside and ask for the receipt Because they didn‚Äôt give me one. They only gave me one to sign and told me that they couldn‚Äôt do a reprint because I went through the drive-through and used tap to pay instead of my physical card. If you run a business I‚Äôm sure you know the business ethics are not professional whatsoever. I didn‚Äôt want my food remade. I let them know that I did touch the french fries my daughter ate those just fine aside from the taste of them and I did technically consume one taco given that I ate the potatoes I wouldn‚Äôt return that, but I did ask for a full refund on the products that I did not eat or drink and that was declined the salsa even tasted like
it had a fridge taste to it and not fresh at all the images are what I didn‚Äôt eat and I will now be giving to my dog because at least for a dog it‚Äôs edible (maybe not the tea though üòÇ)",1742513339,2 months ago,en,2025-03-20T18:28:59

I was disappointed. I must have caught them on an off day. Got my usual of steak tacos. It came with chips & salsa, and charro beans. I was pleased by that.

Unfortunately,
Chips were stale and salsa was watery
Steak was bland and tough
The corn shells were saturated with what tasted like old vegetable oil.

Parking was abundant and restaurant was clean
Server was amicable
Pricing was great
Charro beans were flavorful and were the highlight.

The tacos are stuffed and have plenty of filling, I would say though the Licha with Chorizo needs more Chorizo meat it felt like it was just potatoes cooked in the Chorizo fat. The Brisket in the Rodeo taco was a bit dry and had little flavor. The location itself is a great little place with outdoor seating only.",1737081373,4 months ago,en,2025-01-16T20:36:13

We made a quick trip to San Antonio, and of course wanted breakfast tacos for breakfast on Saturday. I searched a few minutes and found Con Huevos Tacos near us.

It was a chilly (for San Antonio) morning and there were several cars in the lot with customers waiting for their order, but there was nobody sitting outside or in line. The signs made it clear that this isn't typical. There are clearly marked locations for ordering and picking up orders.

Orders are taken at the window and they text you to let you know when your order is ready. There is plenty of outside seating which is usually great for San Antonio's weather. We would have sat outside if our AirBnB wasn't two minutes away.

The food, though, wow! On Saturday, my husband ordered two Carmen tacos, one with a corn tortilla, one with flour, and rojo (red) sauce. I ordered a chilaquiles bowl with verde (green) sauce, with an added fried egg and avocado (note: not sliced, more like guacamole).

The pickled onions in my bowl made my taste buds sing. The warm verde sauce was deliciously flavorful. The house-made tostadas, well, we bought a bag this morning (Sunday) to bring home. My husband declared his tacos the best breakfast tacos he'd ever had. We used to live in Austin, so this is high praise.

We returned this morning before we left town. I had the chilaquiles taco and hubby had the Carmen and Irma, both on flour. We brought 20 flour tortillas, several sides of refried beans, and a bag of tostadas home with us. We know the tacos we make with them will not stand up to the ones we ate this weekend, but they will be elevated.

Do NOT use a credit card here! I always tip when the service is good, which is why I didn't leave a tip the last time I went.

The waiter was taking our drink orders. My friend hesitated for maybe 5 seconds, and then he said I'll be back and stormed off!! Very unprofessional. When the food was ready, he came out with the tortillas and just threw them on the table. I looked at my friends with disbelief. When we needed refills, he never once came by our table to see how everything was going and if we needed any refills or anything else. Then we noticed a couple who came in and sat next to us. They waited for quite some time before he even came around to wait on them. He was too busy talking to someone at the door exit. Then my friend had to get up and look for someone to get him a refill on his tea. Finally, when we were ready to leave, we waited for our ticket and never got it.

The food is getting a little better and they're stepping up their game and are starting to appeal to the masses.

Overall, they are doing better and changing up the menu to suit for different tastes.

At times, the lady(s) who work the register are a little ""rude"" and in time, hopefully that will be worked out.

Henry always met you with a smile, even on his bad days, he didn't treat you mean or talk ugly to you.
Henry WAS customer service and he always corrected whatever was wrong without belittling you or acting like it was your fault. He set the bar for ""Tony's"" to follow.

Moving on...
Yes, you can eat in here, but it's a tight squeeze when the breakfast/lunch crowd is in here, so keep that in mind for your dining experience.

And during these times, yes, expect a long wait in line and for your food.

The food didn‚Äôt very much meet my expectations though. I ordered a beef fajita taco and a bean and cheese taco to go. The tortillas seemed homemade, I ordered the big tacos because I had never been there. The beef fajita could have had a little more meat since it had a lot of space still, the bean and cheese was pretty big and full. The beef fajita lacked flavor and was very plain, it was very tough and over cooked, it had no onions or bell pepper and was only the plain meat that seemed very lightly or unseasoned. The bean and cheese were too hot which made the tortilla pretty soggy and melted the cheese too much. In my opinion, these little details can mean a huge difference.

They were closing at 2 PM on Sunday, and we arrived about 18 minutes before closing. Despite that, they welcomed us warmly ‚Äî no bad looks or rushed service at all. The atmosphere felt just like a restaurant in Mexico.

I ordered the cheese enchiladas plate, and my husband got the barbacoa tacos with all the fixings. The enchiladas came out hot and fresh, and the tortillas for the tacos were homemade ‚Äî so good! Sadly, they were out of horchata since it was so close to closing, but we grabbed some Jarritos instead.

The food was absolutely delicious, and the prices were unbeatable! If we had gone to a bigger, fancier Mexican restaurant, it would‚Äôve cost three times as much. We spent less than $20 (excluding tip), which was a steal for such great food and service. Highly recommend!",1742154916,2 months ago,en,2025-03-16T14:55:16

We were a party of 14 and surprisingly only had to wait a few minutes before being seated. Our waitress was great, she did not mess any orders up, refilled our coffee consistently and was friendly. Most of our party enjoyed their food but some of us did not. I ordered the pancake child plate for my son which was great! And for myself I ordered the Chilaquiles plate with over easy eggs. My food was not very good and had to get my eggs remade since the ones I received were overcooked. It also was a little dry so I had to ask for a side of salsa to add to my plate. My brother in law said his Machacado plate was salty.

All in all it was ok. The place was nice and clean, service was stellar! The food just was lacking, unfortunately. I am glad I tried it but probably would not return.",1721760289,10 months ago,en,2024-07-23T13:44:49

Our party ordered:

2 Barbacoa plates - eggs were per perfectly cooked (1 plate was over medium eggs). Especially since it‚Äôs a hit and miss a lot of time for over medium eggs. Barbacoa was wonderful with great flavor, limited fat, and not overly oily! The tortillas were DEFINITELY hand made and PERFECT!
2 bacon, egg, tacos with potatoes and cheese added - my daughter loved them, she said they were so good and loved the small charred parts on the tortillas.
2 barbacoa tacos - just like plates, wonderful!

Honestly, we were taken back by everything! The green salsa was delicious as well as the table salsa with chips, it was boosting so much flavor.

Wanted to place order soon after for the main dish well that took a while to take. Finally waitress took order down while refilling my coffee and asked her to take the main dish down. Order me two pork chops with scramble eggs and instead of regular potato‚Äôs wanted chorizo potato‚Äôs no problem.

Unseasoned bland & flavorless. At least try a little salt in the eggs.
Second time pancake plate $10.99. again nothing special. the only thing I can say about the plate is the portion wasn't bad. Two good size pancakes, two eggs ordered over medium slightly overcooked, two slices of bacon and toast. Again the eggs completely bland and unseasoned. Pancakes were nothing special. The toast was just two pieces of traditional white bread.  That weren't remotely toasted at all. In fact at best they might have been slapped on a flat iron grill for 2 seconds on either side.
The star of the show was the bacon and even that was nothing special.
Third time Carne guisada taco. Literally steak on a flour tortilla $3.99. Again nothing fabulous. More carne asada than guisada. Bland and flavorless.
This last time I settled for crispy Taco plate 10.99. three tacos your choice beef or chicken served with the rice and beans
I chose beef. Tacos were literally flavorless beef with some lettuce tomato and cheese thrown on top star of the show was the rice.

Can honestly say I'm highly disappointed. Heard great things and read many great reviews regarding their other location. Waited what seem like a century for them to  finish construction and open. Was absolutely hyped when they finally did. However it seems like just a swing and a miss.
Not to mention they charge an additional 40 cents per plate just to box your food to go.

The only Plus is its location relative to my work and making it a convenient place to grab a quick bite however I can get more tasteful food from the 7-Eleven next door.",1744375685,a month ago,en,2025-04-11T07:48:05

Figured I would stop by and try this place since there are mixed-to-positive reviews and seemed worth a shot. I dined in twice and ordered takeout once so far and will likely come back and try other stuff while I town.

The dishes looked exactly as they do in the menu. The tortillas were fresh and delicious, vegetables were crisp and fresh and the salsa & guac were definitely freshly made. I love that they aren't afraid to put a little spice in the salsa.

The staff were very friendly and the food was delivered pretty quick, but not so quick that I assume the stuff is already made in the back. I ordered one of the steak dishes and it was cooked very well for a thin steak (hard to get medium rare at that thickness). The portions were very good for the price.

If I were to address some of the negative reviews, I think the seasoning was perfect. No need for salt or anything. There was an acceptable amount of fat/grease for foods that are made with meat. That's where good flavor comes from.

Lady at window took my order confirmed my order and the I got to window I asked if she charged for both Torta and Sweet tea, she said yes both times as I though the price was low. Later gives me the torta and not the drink, when I ask for the drink she tells me she did not charge me. Then to top it off the torta was cold and the torta bread was toasted on the inside and soggy on the outside (as if old and sitting thier ) no flavor at all.

1.) drive thru employee was talking to a friend in the drive thru. Employee says ‚Äúsee you later.‚Äù Same Customer finally get her her order taken over mic.

2.) I was on 2nd lane W about 4-6 cars ahead of me.  Cars that came after my arrival on first lane were attended before anyone took my order.

3.) waited about 30 mins before employee came out to hand food to 2nd lane.

4.) employee GIVES MY BIG ASS BAG OF FOOD , to her friend, her friend jets fast tf off the property.

5.) employee walks over and asks me ‚Äúwhat?‚Äù Like she knew I was going to tell her.

6.) Employee claims she forgot food inside. Never comes back out w my food. Had to call the store. The cook came out to give me my food, he confirms it needed to be remade.

7.) it‚Äôs just two tacos w rice n beans. Not the same plate I was use to seeing at restaurants.  I haven‚Äôt been there in years and I didn‚Äôt even know it‚Äôs not a true asada plate. I never thought of ordering asada before in the past from this place.

8.) asked to return it to the restaurant.
As I arrive Frank the manager comes out and the first thing he says is
‚ÄúLook, I‚Äôm not going to argue w you but it‚Äôs there on the menu so don‚Äôt say it‚Äôs not.‚Äù
Nobody was arguing. I even admitted I had no idea because I DID NOT READ IT FULLY due to slant in title.

9.) he didn‚Äôt wanted to give me my refund and offered a new plate but made it clear I couldn‚Äôt request a traditional carne asada plate. It will come cut up to tiny pieces. I kindly declined this offer.

10.) still Frank wouldn‚Äôt take no for answer and still offered something else , anything else except what I originally requested. (A GM said I could request this).

11.) Frank offers a fajita plate but it will come sliced up into pieces as well.
Unfortunately, I‚Äôve always disliked fajitas. And at this point ‚Ä¶I‚Äôm very frustrated.

12.) AGAIN, I kindly declined.  Requested my refund for the third time. He finally said okay.

Driving from Eagle Pass, TX to San Antonio on New Year‚Äôs Day, we hit a major roadblock‚Äîevery Mexican restaurant we tried was closed. After five unsuccessful stops, I was on the verge of giving up when I stumbled upon Taqueria Jalisco, and thank goodness I did!

As a business owner, I totally understand that employees deserve their holiday time off, but when a craving hits, it‚Äôs hard to ignore. The team at Taqueria Jalisco truly came through for us, serving us delicious food when most places were closed, and I can‚Äôt thank them enough for that.

The food itself? Amazing! The tortillas were soft, fresh, and perfect‚Äîsomething simple, but done so well. The portion sizes were just right, and their green salsa? I‚Äôm officially obsessed! It had the perfect balance of spice and flavor, making everything even better.

The staff was friendly and efficient, and the overall experience was a great one.

It probably would've been a 5 Star review
BUT, even though it said COVID-19 precautions were in effect, several people walked in without masks and it wasn't enforced.
On the flip side, my kids enjoy their fries and bean and cheese tacos, and the food didn't disappoint them.
I ordered the Jalisco Burrito Supremo and it served it's purpose well.
It was covered in the carne guisada gravy and cheese.
Plus, it had plenty of meat inside, they didn't skimp on the meat portion.
This didn't come with the beans and rice which worked out since the burrito was a handful.
My wife ordered the chicken gordita and it had a good amount of chicken.
She ordered the lemonade which seemed a little expensive at $3.24 for a 32 oz to go cup.
Was I wrong in believing it was expensive?
Overall, I'd give it a 4 Star rating, a high B+.

While the food was delicious, I would suggest serving the salsa for the tacos in a ramekin instead of directly on the plate. It would elevate the presentation and make the dish feel a bit more polished.

Acenar delivers on both taste and service, with hearty portions and bold flavors. The short rib tacos are a standout dish, and the overall experience was delightful. With just a small tweak in presentation, it would be absolutely perfect. I‚Äôll definitely return for another great meal!",1733535825,6 months ago,en,2024-12-06T19:43:45

The salsa was on point. Very legit. The chips were light and crispy and almost like a baked chip. We ordered the table side guacamole, which was fun üòÅ.  The chips that came with that weren't awesome. Kinda chewy and stale, but still ok.

We ordered a couple of quesadillas and several different enchilada plates. All were good. Again, basic standard fare. The dishes we really enjoyed were the shrimp tacos and the chicken mol√©. Both of those were really good.

Service was hit and miss. The server was really nice, gave good suggestions, and got our order in and to the table really fast. Refills were slow in coming and a couple of things we had to ask for several times. When things got busy or stuff got missed, the frustration from our server was obvious and awkward.

Now, let‚Äôs give a shout-out to our fabulous server, Elvia! Attentive, polite, and all-around delightful. She kept our chips and salsa flowing like a pro. Speaking of chips ‚Äî they‚Äôre light, airy, and dangerously addictive. The salsa? It‚Äôs got just the right kick to remind you that life‚Äôs too short for bland food.

And now, the main event: the food!

The caldo de res was pure comfort in a bowl ‚Äî rich, flavorful broth with loads of tender meat. It‚Äôs served piping hot with your choice of homemade corn or flour tortillas. (Spoiler: you‚Äôll want both.)

Then came the Mexican Hamburger ‚Äî and let me tell you, it‚Äôs a beast. This burger is massive, juicy, and packed with more fresh meat than a prison yard! You won‚Äôt leave hungry, that‚Äôs for sure.

The Fideo Loco? Served with charro beans and seasoned to perfection. One bite, and you‚Äôll wonder why you ever settled for boring noodles.

And let‚Äôs not forget the cheese enchiladas ‚Äî melty, well-seasoned, and bursting with flavor. They hit all the right notes.

They need to work on their customer engagement skills because they are literally the face of the restaurant.
Our server was nice, a little all over the place, talking back to her coworkers while she was still serving us, but it is what it is. We're all human, that's understandable. Still, I left her a 20% tip.
The food was OK, nothing extraordinary. I ordered a mojito, which tasted like coconut water, and the mint didn't look fresh at all. As a bartender, I recommend they put a little more effort into the details bc a drink as classic and easy as that isn't easy to mess up, yet it wasn't memorable at all.

I researched high-end Mexican restaurants in San Antonio, and Google recommended Paloma Blanca.  Its location seemed a bit odd. It was not in a high traffic consumer area.  One had to intentionally drive there. You would not just happen on this place.  My first impression was that parking was very limited for a Friday lunch crowd.  The parking lot was small, full, and had angled parking spots, further complicating access.  We were then greeted by a very un-asthecially pleasing building.  Once inside, a very attentive greater told us to wait by the fire as they prepared a table for 2.  The atmosphere was very comfortable with a modern yet rustic feel.  After about 5 minutes,  we were escorted up a small staircase into another section of the restaurant and you could see through the large windows that the restaurant was quite expensive stretching very far back with another upper section in the back.  A huge patio area complete with outdoor heaters was well appointed with shrubbery.  Our waiter, was fluent in both English and Spanish which would be expected in a high-end Mexican restaurant.   Although,  being bilingual myself, i do look forward to ordering in Spanish and surprising the staff as i look like a stereotypical g√ºero.  And, it adds to the whole authenticity feel of the experience.   While nice,this place did not feel like a Mexican restaurant at all.  The food tasted good but didn't feel like it was worth the exorbitant price.  The tableware was clean and of good quality.  I find that to be an often overlooked part of dining.

Other Las palapas don't live up to it especially the one off of highway 151 and I think it's potranco but basically in that area. Is there a good father plate is good know we've had better like at Los Cocos on Bandera Road.
